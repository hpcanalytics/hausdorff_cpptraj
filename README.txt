The 2D-RMS matrix is a simple Ascii file (as attached).  To run with MPI and not do a tightly integrated code, I can subdivide the for i=1->128, for j=1->128 into separate CPPTRAJ calls (which can be single core or OpenMP) for each comparison, write the output matrix and then call the Hausdorff python on the 2D-RMS matrix files... This will be slower than tightly integrated (which would avoid the file I/O), but I'll see if I can get this going via a shell script.
